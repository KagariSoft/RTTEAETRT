 Ren'Xel, is an app that generates an Excel file from Ren'Py's dialogue.tab file using python technology, it is also able to generate a .rpy translation file to import translations faster. The app was intended for developers to send only the Excel and extra files such as common.rpy or images to their translators. This method is not intended to replace the native renpy system, it is just an alternative that allows a more visual translation without having to touch the .rpy file of the dialogs or screens.
